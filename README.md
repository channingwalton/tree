# Tree augmented by references between nodes

## 1. Executive Summary

The tree is a specialized tree-based data structure that supports unique node identification through UUIDs and enables node duplication with intelligent reference management. This document outlines the complete requirements for implementing the tree data structure.

## 2. Overview

### 2.1 Purpose
The library provides a tree structure where:
- Nodes can have multiple children
- Each node has a unique UUID identifier
- Nodes can have named references to other nodes in the graph
- Child nodes can be duplicated with automatic reference resolution

### 2.2 Key Characteristics
- **Tree Structure**: Fundamentally a tree with parent-child relationships
- **Multiple Children**: Each node can have 1 or more children
- **Named Reference System**: Nodes can reference other nodes with named relationships
- **UUID Identifiers**: Simple, unique identification using UUIDs
- **Smart Duplication**: Copy operations intelligently update internal references
